# Fitch Proof Builder

> An intuitive tool that helps you construct fitch proofs visually, and then converts the proofs to LaTeX!

## How to Use Proof Builder

Here's a [Video Explainer](https://youtu.be/EOVSMfXQCIE). It follows the steps below

1. Download the `fitch.sty` file from [here](https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/fitch/fitch.sty)
2. Upload `fitch.sty` into the root of your LaTeX project
3. Use the [Visual Proof Builder](https://michaelmherrera.github.io/fitch/index.html) to generate the LaTeX for your fitch proof.
4. Copy the generated LaTex into your project.
